In this project I have to build an online portfolio to showcase the work I’ve created as part of this program, 
and any projects I’ve built on my own. This is my chance to show the world the work I’ve done. 
In fact, the portfolio site itself is a great way to show what I can do. 
Bring all of my talents with HTML, CSS and JavaScript together to create a fun and interactive online portfolio. 
I’ll host the portfolio site on the web using either a traditional web hosting company or free GitHub Pages.
